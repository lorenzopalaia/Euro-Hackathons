            </h2>
            <p>
              Euro Hackathons may provide you with access to the Application
              Programming Interface (&quot;API&quot;) to enable you to access
              certain data and functionality of the Service. Your use of the API
              is subject to these Terms and any additional terms and conditions
              provided by Euro Hackathons.
            </p>
            <p>
              You agree to use the API only for purposes that are permitted by
              these Terms and any applicable law, regulation, or generally
              accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Euro Hackathons reserves the right to suspend or terminate your
              access to the API at any time, with or without cause, and with or
              without notice.
            </p>
            <p>
              You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your
              API key and for all activities that occur under your API key. You
              agree to notify Euro Hackathons immediately of any unauthorized
              use of your API key or any other breach of security.
            </p>
            <p>
              Euro Hackathons may impose limitations on the use of the API,
              including but not limited to the frequency and volume of requests,
              and the amount of data accessed or retrieved. These limitations
              may be updated from time to time at Euro Hackathons&apos; sole
              discretion.

            <p>
              Recent updates include expanded filtering options, a theme
              management system (with presets and light/dark mode stored in
              localStorage), and a revamped scheduling pipeline for the data
              ingestion jobs which now runs multiple times per day with
              staggered cron windows to reduce load. The API rate limits have
              also been clarified in the API section.
